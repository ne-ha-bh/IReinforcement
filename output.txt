What is a Tester Test the IC – Often called DUT or Device Under Test. Provides input (or stimulus) to the DUT and compares its response The stimulus and measurements are conveyed through DUT pins – Inputs , Outputs or bi-directional IO’s (pins that can receives input stimulus as well as provide an output response) Has resources for various types of DUT pins Digital DC/Power – Voltage and Current RF – Radio Frequency Analog / DSP (Digital signal Processing ) Is Operated through software control what is called a test programProvides high throughput – can test multiple pins and DUTs simultaneously  Tester Types Older testers were dedicated for specific IC Types –Digital Testers Memory Testers Analog Testers Mixed Signal Testers Rack and Stack Modern Testers can test ICs that have a higher level of integration For example , a single IC today can have Digital , Memory  , Mixed Signal and Analog Functionality – referred to as a System on Chip . These testers are called SOC testers with “insurance” to test various DUT functions. Package testing WLCSP – Wafer Level chip scale package Packaging completed at the wafer level , include contact pads. Allow testing at the wafer level . Considered as “final” testing. Eliminates one test process .  Compared with traditional , wafer probe + final test. Evolution of package testing Recent package development has introduced two new types of testing process –Strip Test WLCSPStrip Testing – refers to the process whereby semiconductor devices are electrically tested while they are still in their lead frame strips. Advantages –Include testing as part of the assembly process. Capable of handling huge multi- sites testing. Instead of multiple insertions , only need one single frame insertion Test Program vs Datasheet Test - program are written by Test Engineer , and in accordance with Product Engineer’s document called Test Plan or Test Specification. The device test-specifications are derived from specification document , called “Device Datasheet”. When creating the test plan , the product engineer will consider : Criticality versus the testability of the Data sheet space. Technical capability of the targeted ATR System. Budgeted cost of test – typically translates into test time of a single DUT. Hence it is important for Test engineer to read and understand device datasheet – which is the foundation for the test plan.
