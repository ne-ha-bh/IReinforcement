9,What is a Tester,"What is a Tester Test the IC – Often called DUT or Device Under Test. Provides input (or stimulus) to the DUT and compares its response The stimulus and measurements are conveyed through DUT pins – Inputs , Outputs or bi-directional IO’s (pins that can receives input stimulus as well as provide an output response) Has resources for various types of DUT pins Digital DC/Power – Voltage and Current RF – Radio Frequency Analog / DSP (Digital signal Processing ) Is Operated through software control what is called a test programProvides high throughput – can test multiple pins and DUTs simultaneously "
10,Tester Types,"Tester Types Older testers were dedicated for specific IC Types –Digital Testers Memory Testers Analog Testers Mixed Signal Testers Rack and Stack Modern Testers can test ICs that have a higher level of integration For example , a single IC today can have Digital , Memory  , Mixed Signal and Analog Functionality – referred to as a System on Chip . These testers are called SOC testers with “insurance” to test various DUT functions."
19,Package testing,"Package testing WLCSP – Wafer Level chip scale package Packaging completed at the wafer level , include contact pads. Allow testing at the wafer level . Considered as “final” testing. Eliminates one test process .  Compared with traditional , wafer probe + final test."
18,Evolution of package testing,"Evolution of package testing Recent package development has introduced two new types of testing process –Strip Test WLCSPStrip Testing – refers to the process whereby semiconductor devices are electrically tested while they are still in their lead frame strips. Advantages –Include testing as part of the assembly process. Capable of handling huge multi- sites testing. Instead of multiple insertions , only need one single frame insertion"
15,Test Program vs Datasheet,"Test Program vs Datasheet Test - program are written by Test Engineer , and in accordance with Product Engineer’s document called Test Plan or Test Specification. The device test-specifications are derived from specification document , called “Device Datasheet”. When creating the test plan , the product engineer will consider : Criticality versus the testability of the Data sheet space. Technical capability of the targeted ATR System. Budgeted cost of test – typically translates into test time of a single DUT. Hence it is important for Test engineer to read and understand device datasheet – which is the foundation for the test plan."
14,Tester Software,"Tester Software  Tester Software includes multiple functions & ToolsBuilt-in tools for creating test programs. Runtime software for controlling hardware. API library to control tester instruments. Tools for debug , integration , and characterization of test program. Network tools for communication with control software and other members of test cell. Software tools to analyze test results. User Interface commands basic interface template , which customer can customized or even to integrated into their manufacture environment"
1,What is Semiconductor,"What is Semiconductor Semiconductor is a material that lies between the two extension – A Conductor , which conducts current. An Insulator , which prevents current flow.Since it’s properties can be tuned , semiconductors are versatile for making electronic devices. The devices made from semiconductors are called Integrated Circuits.(IC for short). The semiconductor industry has grown significantly over time from simple transistors in 1947 to over a $500B Industry today 2021."
2,Semiconductor Process,"Semiconductor Process Semiconductor Process covers – IC Design Front End : Fabrication of Wafers. Back End : Assembly , Packaging and Testing.Front End can include testing before cutting / dicing of Wafer – This is called Wafer sort or Wafer testing . At the Back End , testing is done after assembly and packaging – This is called Final Test."
6,Value of Test,"Value of Test Why test devices if you end up throwing some out negative valueThe cost of returned devices is much higher. Miniaturization complicates board rework , if need to replace bad device. Manufacturer’s reputation is important due to competition. Consumer market expectations of high-quality product."
17,Software to interface with Handler,"Software to interface with Handler  There are 3 types of communication links between Tester to Handler / Prober: RS232(serial type digital interface) Parallel Interface General purpose Interface BusType of interface Communication between tester and handler is handled via a separate software package that comes with the equipment. On Cohu platform , this package is called CURI.CURI stands for Cross platform Unified Robot Interface. It requires a configuration file to configure the communication setup for a specific handler. Example prober makes are TEL , TSK and OPUS.Example Handler make are Delta , Ismeca , Seiko-Espon , MCT."
8,Load Board and PIB,Load Board and PIB The interface between the tester and the DUT is through Printed Circuit Boards:-  1. Load Board or DIB DIB stands for Devices Interface Board Interface for Packaged Parts Sits between Tester and Handler 2. Prober Interface Board or Probe Card Interface for Wafers Sits between Tester an Prober
13,Digital Pins,Digital Pins Digital pins have finite sets of values –  Commonly 2 types of values . Logic High or Logic Low. Provides Digital control and response – As input to the IC and output response from the IC Digital pins can be single – ended or differential 2 wires carrying complementary statesHow fast digital data transfer in or out of an IC is referred to as the frequency. Frequency of digital signal vary by the IC and its end application . From 1 MHz or below to greater that 12 GHz
16,What is Scan Test,"What is Scan Test Scan uses interconnected flips-flops, called Scan flip-flops. Scan flip-flops add the following connection to a basic flip-flop –Scan Enable Scan Data In Scan Data Out Scan Procedure – Data on the Scan Input is shifted into the scan flip-flop when scan enable is set. Data is clocked into the combinational logic. The output of the combination logic is captured on the scan flip-flop and shifted out on the scan output when scan enable is set."
11,Testing Approach,"Testing Approach ICs are tested for : Validating and Debugging IC Design Characterizing IC PerformanceProduction Testing of ICs Tester provides input to the DUT and compares its responseThe stimulus and measurement are conveyed through DUT pins – Output , input or bi-directional IO’s pins that can receive input stimulus as well as provides an output response "
12,Common type of test,Common type of test DC parametric testsDigital tests Structural – Scan / Design for test Functional test – verify device truth table functionality Memory test – verify device memoryAnalog test Mixed – signal test – tests include both digital and analog. RF test
3,Semiconductor Manufacturers,"Semiconductor Manufacturers Manufacturers of integrated Circuits requires multiple steps in a tightly controlled environment. 1. Integrated device Manufacturers are companies that design , manufacture , and sell ICs IDM : Intel , TI , Samsung , Microchip ,etc. 2. Some companies just design IC’s only called Fabless. Fabless : Qualcomm , Mediatek , etc. 3. Fabless outsource Fabrication , Packaging & Testing steps to Subcontractor vendors called Subcons or OSATsSubcon/OSATs : ASE , KYEC , Amkor , etc. (OSAT stand for Outsource Assembly and Test"
7,Test Cell,Test Cell
5,Why is IC Testing Needed,Why is IC Testing Needed Faults in manufacturing of wafers and packaging of die are common Process Issues Dielectric Issues Infant Mortality Issues Static electricity Contamination Resistive and inductive bridges in the silicon wafers and package during die bonding to package leads.
4,What is ATE,What is ATE ATE stands for Automatic Test EquipmentATE incudes the tester as well as the production handling equipment such as probers and handlers – commonly known as the Test Cell. ATE is a subset of the Semiconductor industry. ATE is used for Testing ICs before and after packaging. Sort BAD and GOOD devices. Validate and Debug IC design in Lab. Characteristics IC Performance in Lab. Production test or volume test of ICs.
